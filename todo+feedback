Open to-do's:
    - comparison table - FlyUIBK-LDA
        - delayed/on-time/not-on-time/cancelled
    - explaining performance differences due to FlyUIBKs high outliers
        - LDA cancelled, while flyuibk didn't but had high delay --> more of an positive observation for FlyUIBK
        - FlyUIBK performs better if we observe all delays, not just the ones defined as delay (>15min)
    - maybe normalize time differences by adding those to the delays of LDA
    - hypothesis test whether FlyUIBK actually performs worse than LDA --> additionally preparing test whether data
      comes from the same population
      --> test necessary for non-normal distributed data
    - goal is to follow the logic:
        1. "classic" performance measures
        2. highlight problems with those and propose
        3. conclusion whether the performance is actually worse/better than LDA's performance
